Golf Tourney Scorecard allows users to create and join golf tournaments for a friendly round of golf. Players keep their own score throughout the round and will be able to view the scores of all other players within the same tournament in real time via the Leaderboard. 

Currently, a tournament can only be one round of 18 holes.

## Additional Features:

* Chat with the other players in your tournament.
* Get current weather, wind speed and wind direction of your location.
* Locate the course youâ€™re playing via google maps.
